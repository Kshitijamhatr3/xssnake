Introduction to XSSnake
XSSnake is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed for identifying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. Developed in Python, XSSnake harnesses popular libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and colorama to deliver an efficient and thorough solution for web security assessments.

Key Features:
- Customizable Payloads: Test for XSS vulnerabilities using payloads from a user-specified text file, allowing for tailored testing based on specific scenarios and threats.

- Form Parameter Scanning: Automatically detects and tests parameters in HTML forms for both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities.

- Detailed Results: Provides clear, color-coded output to indicate success, failure, and error statuses for each payload and parameter tested.

- Error Handling: Robust error management ensures the tool continues scanning even if some requests fail, providing a comprehensive overview of potential vulnerabilities.

- User-Friendly Interface: Prompts users for necessary inputs such as target URL and payload file path, making the tool easy to use and flexible.

- Enhanced Output: Displays a colorful and informative banner to highlight the toolâ€™s branding and provide a clear indication of the scanning progress.

How It Works:
Open the terminal and follow these detailed steps as shown:
- Use the nano xssnake.py command to create or edit the xssnake.py file.
- List the contents of the directory with the ls command to verify the presence of xssnake.py.
- Make the xssnake.py file executable by running the chmod +x xssnake.py command.
- Again, list the contents of the directory with the ls command to confirm the changes.

As shown in the image, the lab 'Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded' is not solved. Copy the following URL to the lab: 0a47005e0316b4018171e3a300ca00db.web-security-academy.net.

Execute the script using python3 xssnake.py.
- Enter the target URL: https://0a47005e0316b4018171e3a300ca00db.web-security-academy.net/.
- Provide the full path to the payload file: /root/Desktop/payload/payload.txt.
- Select the parameter number to test by entering: 1.
- As shown in the image, follow the steps exactly to ensure correct execution of the XSS scanning tool
